    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The protagonist's journey from personal desire to societal responsibility is well-articulated, with a clear internal conflict between her longing for immortality and her skepticism about the drug's safety. Her ultimate choice to reveal the truth demonstrates a significant internal transformation, supported by her actions and decisions over time.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "While the narrative does not heavily rely on sensory details or recurring objects as memory triggers, the protagonist's memories and reflections on her past desires and current responsibilities serve as emotional anchors, though more sensory specificity could enhance the emotional depth.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story effectively spans generations, highlighting the protagonist's relationship with her granddaughter and the long-term consequences of the drug. The narrative could further emphasize the behavioral contrasts between different generations to deepen the exploration of long-term causality.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The narrative touches on the ethical complexities of government and corporate interests but lacks detailed exploration of these institutions' diverse motives. More specific evidence of institutional actions and their direct impact on the protagonist's choices would strengthen this aspect.",

The risks and costs associated with her investigation are clear, though the narrative could benefit from more suspenseful pacing and layered clues.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story presents internal and interpersonal conflicts, particularly between the protagonist and her granddaughter. However, the transpersonal conflicts with institutions are less developed, and a more integrated approach to these layers could enhance the narrative's complexity.",

The causal chain of motivation, action, and consequence is clear and logically constructed, avoiding coincidences.",

The pacing could be more dynamic to heighten tension, especially in the investigation phase.",

The societal reflection on immortality continues to influence the narrative, creating lasting aftershocks.",
    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending successfully addresses both personal and societal issues, with the protagonist's sacrifice prompting a broader reflection on the value of immortality. The moral ambiguity is well-maintained, avoiding simplistic resolutions and encouraging ongoing reflection."
