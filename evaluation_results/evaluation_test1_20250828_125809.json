    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The protagonist faces a profound moral dilemma, choosing between revealing the truth about the drug's side effects and protecting his loved ones from forgetting him. His internal transformation is evident as he shifts from despair to determination, driven by personal loss and societal injustice.",

The consequences of early-life decisions are well-explored through generational differences.",
