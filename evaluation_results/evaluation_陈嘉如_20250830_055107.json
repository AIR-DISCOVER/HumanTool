    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The narrative does not effectively utilize memory anchors or sensory details. The discovery of ancient scripts could serve as a memory trigger, but the text lacks specific sensory descriptions to enhance emotional or cognitive changes.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story does not clearly present an intergenerational timeline or long-term consequences. The focus is on immediate survival rather than exploring generational differences or the long-term impact of past actions.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The depiction of the alien invaders lacks complexity, portraying them as purely antagonistic forces. There is no exploration of their motives or ethical dimensions, which limits the narrative's depth.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The narrative includes elements of investigation, such as exploring the mysterious cave, but lacks a structured clue architecture. The discoveries are not layered or connected in a way that builds suspense or rhythm.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story presents internal and external conflicts, but they are not deeply interconnected. The protagonist's internal struggle is overshadowed by the external threat, and there is limited exploration of interpersonal or institutional conflicts.",

    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The story follows a basic three-act structure with a clear climax, but the hierarchy of beats is not well-defined. The midpoint lacks a significant rule-changing reversal, and the climax, while impactful, is somewhat predictable.",
