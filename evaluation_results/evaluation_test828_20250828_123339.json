    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "While there is a journey and discovery of magical powers, the investigative aspect is minimal. The narrative lacks a structured clue architecture that builds suspense or rhythm.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story presents internal, interpersonal, and extra-personal conflicts, with Aileen's internal fears, team dynamics, and alien threats. These layers interact well, though the interpersonal conflicts could be more pronounced.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The narrative includes value shifts, such as fear to courage, but these transitions could be more causally linked and nuanced. Some turns feel abrupt, lacking detailed motivation-action-effect chains.",
