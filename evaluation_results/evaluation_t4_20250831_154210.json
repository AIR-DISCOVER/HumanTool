The institutions' actions directly impact the protagonist's choices, though further exploration of their internal logic and diverse motives could add complexity.",

    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending resonates on both personal and public levels, addressing the protagonist's psychological closure and societal change. It maintains moral ambiguity and avoids simplistic resolutions, effectively prompting reflection on life's true value."
