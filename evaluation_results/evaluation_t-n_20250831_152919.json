    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story lacks an intergenerational perspective or long-term causality. It focuses on immediate events and lacks clear time markers or consequences that span generations.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The depiction of alien invaders lacks complexity, presenting them as a monolithic threat without nuanced motives. There is little exploration of institutional or technological ethics.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The narrative includes elements of investigation, particularly in the exploration of the mysterious cave, but the clues and their connections are not deeply layered or suspenseful.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story presents conflicts on multiple levels—internal, interpersonal, and extra-personal—but these are not deeply interconnected or developed, often resolved too conveniently.",
