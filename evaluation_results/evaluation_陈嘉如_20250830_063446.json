    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The protagonist, Chen Jiaru, faces a significant moral dilemma, particularly in the third act, where she must choose between personal safety and revealing the truth. However, her internal motivations and transformations could be more deeply explored to enhance character depth.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The narrative lacks specific memory anchors or sensory details that could enrich the story. The focus is more on plot progression rather than using sensory images to trigger memories or decisions.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story effectively spans Chen Jiaru's life from 28 to 85, showing the long-term consequences of early-life decisions. The intergenerational impact is implied through the \"lost generation,\" but could be more explicitly detailed.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The narrative presents a basic depiction of government and scientific institutions, but lacks depth in exploring their motives and ethical complexities. The institutions are portrayed more as antagonistic forces without nuanced motivations.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "Chen Jiaru's investigation into the drug's side effects drives the plot, with a logical progression of discoveries. However, the narrative could benefit from more detailed clue architecture and rising costs associated with her investigation.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story includes internal, interpersonal, and extra-personal conflicts, particularly Chen Jiaru's internal struggles and societal pressures. However, these conflicts could be more intricately connected to amplify the narrative tension.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The narrative includes clear value shifts, such as from ignorance to awareness and from oppression to empowerment. These shifts are causally linked, though some transitions could be more smoothly integrated.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The narrative structure includes a clear climax with Chen Jiaru's decision to reveal the truth. However, the midpoint and escalation could be more distinctly marked to enhance narrative tension.",
    "Emotional Punch & Aftershock": "While the climax delivers an emotional impact, the narrative lacks sustained aftershocks that resonate throughout the story. The emotional peaks could be more effectively echoed in subsequent scenes.",
    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending addresses both personal closure for Chen Jiaru and societal change, as the truth about the drug is revealed. However, the resolution could maintain more moral ambiguity and openness regarding institutional responses."
