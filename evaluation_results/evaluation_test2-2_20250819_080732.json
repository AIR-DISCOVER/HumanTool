    "Character Depth and Empathy": "The protagonist is portrayed with a clear internal struggle, as they face the consequences of immortality and the loss of emotional depth. Their interactions with non-immortals and the gradual realization of life's finite value provide depth. However, the empathy could be enhanced by more nuanced exploration of their emotional journey.",
    "Thematic Expression and Ideological Argument": "The story effectively conveys themes of life, death, and the value of finite existence. The climax offers a clear ideological argument against the superficial allure of immortality, emphasizing the richness of finite life. The opposing viewpoint is dramatized through societal pressure and the protagonist's internal conflict.",
    "Narrative Craft and Visual Storytelling": "The narrative uses vivid imagery, such as the fading shadow, to symbolize the protagonist's existential crisis. Dialogue and interactions with non-immortals reveal subtext and drive the plot. While the visual storytelling is effective, the integration of an image system could be more seamless.",
    "Plot Logic and Causality": "The plot is logically structured with clear causal links between events. The protagonist's journey from denial to acceptance is driven by meaningful conflicts and discoveries. The use of coincidence is minimal and well-placed early in the narrative, enhancing realism and inevitability.",
    "Story Structure and Turning Points": "The story is well-structured with clear beats, scenes, and acts. Each turning point is meaningful, pushing the protagonist into deeper dilemmas. The climax offers an irreversible value change, releasing significant emotion and meaning. The crisis presents a true dilemma, effectively resolved in the climax.",
    "Conflict Depth and Antagonism": "The narrative presents conflicts at multiple levels: internal, personal, and societal. The protagonist's struggle with immortality and societal pressure provides depth. However, the extrapersonal conflict could be more complex, with greater exploration of societal forces and their impact on the protagonist's choices."
