    "Character Depth and Empathy": "The protagonist's journey from exclusion to revelation provides a basis for empathy, but the character's internal struggles and transformation are not deeply explored. The moral dilemma he faces is clear, yet his emotional depth and personal growth could be further developed to enhance audience connection.",
    "Thematic Expression and Ideological Argument": "The story effectively conveys themes of truth, exclusion, and the human condition, culminating in a climax that questions the pursuit of immortality. The thematic argument is clear, though it could be more nuanced, particularly in exploring the broader societal implications and personal stakes.",
    "Narrative Craft and Visual Storytelling": "The narrative presents a dramatic conflict between truth and deception, but the resolution feels somewhat predictable. While the story argues its core idea effectively, it could benefit from a more dynamic interplay of opposing viewpoints to enhance its dramatic impact.",
    "Plot Logic and Causality": "The plot follows a logical progression, with events causally linked to the protagonist's discoveries and actions. The narrative maintains internal consistency, though the reliance on government conspiracy as a plot device could be more creatively developed to avoid predictability.",
    "Story Structure and Turning Points": "The story is well-structured, with clear turning points that escalate the protagonist's challenges. The crisis and climax are effectively constructed, though the resolution could be more surprising to maximize emotional impact and thematic resonance.",
    "Conflict Depth and Antagonism": "The conflict is primarily external, centered on the protagonist's struggle against a corrupt government. While this provides tension, the internal and personal levels of conflict could be more intricately developed to deepen the narrative and challenge the protagonist's humanity."
