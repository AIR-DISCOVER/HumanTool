    "Character Depth and Empathy": "The protagonist is portrayed with depth, as his personal struggle against societal norms and his determination to reveal the truth are well-developed. His empathy for the younger generation and his sacrifices create a strong emotional connection with the audience. However, more exploration of his internal conflicts and motivations could enhance character depth further.",
    "Thematic Expression and Ideological Argument": "The story effectively explores universal themes such as the quest for immortality, the consequences of technological advancements, and the moral implications of societal choices. The climax delivers a clear controlling idea that truth and sacrifice can lead to societal change. The opposing viewpoint is dramatized through societal resistance, adding complexity to the ideological argument.",
    "Narrative Craft and Visual Storytelling": "The narrative provides a solid structure with vivid descriptions of the protagonist's aging and the societal impact of the drug. However, the dialogue and visual storytelling could be more dynamic and concise to enhance tension and character subtext. The integration of an image system is not evident, which could enrich the narrative's emotional depth.",
    "Plot Logic and Causality": "The plot is logically structured, with events unfolding in a coherent sequence driven by the protagonist's discoveries and actions. The causal chain is consistent, avoiding random coincidences. However, the transition between key events could be more fluid to enhance the story's realism and inevitability.",
    "Story Structure and Turning Points": "The story is well-structured with clear acts and turning points, including the protagonist's discovery of the drug's side effects and the final public revelation. Each act builds pressure and forces difficult choices, culminating in a meaningful climax. However, the crisis could present a more profound dilemma to intensify the emotional impact.",
    "Conflict Depth and Antagonism": "The story presents a complex network of conflicts across personal, societal, and ideological levels. The protagonist faces internal struggles, societal opposition, and government antagonism, effectively pushing him to his limits. The progression from contrary to negation is well-executed, reflecting the principle that life is conflict."
