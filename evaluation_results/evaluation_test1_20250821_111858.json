    "Character Depth and Empathy": "The protagonist, Ellie, is given a clear arc from an ordinary student to a leader, but her internal struggles and motivations could be more deeply explored. The story provides a basic level of empathy through her loss and determination, but it lacks the complexity and multidimensionality that would make her journey more compelling.",
    "Thematic Expression and Ideological Argument": "The theme of unity and belief is effectively conveyed through the narrative, particularly in the climax where Ellie chooses to fight for humanity's future. The story presents a clear controlling idea, though it could further explore opposing viewpoints to deepen its ideological argument.",
    "Narrative Craft and Visual Storytelling": "The story uses vivid descriptions and action to convey the plot, but the dialogue and imagery could be more dynamic and varied. While the narrative is clear, it lacks the subtlety and richness of a well-integrated image system that could enhance its emotional impact.",
    "Plot Logic and Causality": "The plot follows a logical progression with clear causal links between events. The narrative avoids major coincidences, and the climax is well-prepared. However, some plot points could be more intricately developed to enhance the sense of inevitability and realism.",
    "Story Structure and Turning Points": "The story is structured around key turning points, with a clear progression from the initial setup to the final climax. Each act builds on the previous one, though the transitions could be more impactful. The climax provides a satisfying resolution, but the buildup to the crisis could be more intense.",
    "Conflict Depth and Antagonism": "The story presents a clear external conflict with the alien invasion, but the internal and personal conflicts could be more developed. The antagonistic forces are present, but they lack the depth and complexity that would push the protagonist to her limits and create a more engaging narrative."
