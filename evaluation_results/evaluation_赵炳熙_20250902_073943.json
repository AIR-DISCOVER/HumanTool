The inciting incident, the protagonist's exclusion from the benefits of immortality, is a strong turning point that sets the stage for the unfolding drama.

The stakes are high, and the choices made by the protagonist are significant.",

The climax results in an irreversible shift, though the controlling idea could be more explicitly reinforced to leave a lasting impression.",
