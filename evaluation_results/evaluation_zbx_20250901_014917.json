    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "Chen Jiaru's character is driven by a clear goal to uncover the truth about the drug, but her internal conflict and moral dilemmas could be more deeply explored. The choice between revealing the truth and self-preservation is significant but lacks detailed internal reasoning and transformation.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The narrative lacks specific sensory details and recurring memory anchors that could enhance emotional depth and plot progression. The story would benefit from more vivid sensory descriptions and objects that trigger memories or decisions.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story effectively spans Chen Jiaru's life from 28 to 85, highlighting the long-term consequences of societal decisions. The intergenerational aspect is present, but the impact on younger generations could be more explicitly detailed.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The narrative presents a government and scientific community with questionable motives, but the complexity of these institutions is not fully explored. More nuanced portrayal of their interests and fears would enhance the ethical complexity.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "While there is an investigation into the drug's effects, the narrative lacks detailed, layered clues and the rising costs associated with discovery. The suspense could be heightened with a more structured clue architecture.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story includes internal, interpersonal, and societal conflicts, but these layers are not fully interconnected. The narrative could benefit from more scenes where these conflicts amplify each other and drive the protagonist to an extreme test.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The narrative has clear value shifts, such as from ignorance to awareness, but the causal links between scenes could be stronger. Some transitions feel abrupt and could be more cohesively connected.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The story follows a clear structure with a midpoint where Chen Jiaru discovers a prevention method, but the escalation towards the climax could be more pronounced. The climax is impactful but lacks an unexpected twist.",
    "Emotional Punch & Aftershock": "Key scenes, such as the revelation of the drug's side effects, have emotional impact, but the aftershocks are not deeply explored. The narrative could benefit from showing longer-term emotional consequences.",
    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending addresses both personal and societal issues, with Chen Jiaru achieving psychological closure and societal change. However, the resolution could retain more ambiguity and complexity to avoid a simplistic conclusion."
