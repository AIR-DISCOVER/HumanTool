  "justifications": {
    "Character Depth and Empathy": "The characters are defined primarily by their generational roles, with the younger generation eager to use magic and the older generation advocating caution. While this sets up a clear conflict, the characters lack individual depth and complexity. The narrative does not delve deeply into their personal motivations or internal struggles, which limits the audience's ability to empathize with them on a profound level.",
    "Thematic Expression and Ideological Argument": "The story effectively explores the theme of balance between ethics and power, particularly through the \"symbiosis\" concept. The ideological argument is clear, with the resolution demonstrating the necessity of intergenerational cooperation. However, the opposing viewpoints could be more robustly dramatized to avoid a didactic presentation of the theme.",
    "Narrative Craft and Visual Storytelling": "The text outlines a strong narrative structure but lacks vivid, concrete descriptions that would enhance visual storytelling. The dialogue and action are not detailed, which limits the potential for showing rather than telling. The story could benefit from more dynamic scenes that reveal character and emotion through action and dialogue.",
    "Plot Logic and Causality": "The plot follows a logical progression with clear causality, as the younger generation's actions lead to escalating conflicts and eventual resolution through collaboration. The events are meaningfully connected, though the reliance on generational archetypes makes some developments predictable. The story avoids deus ex machina resolutions, maintaining internal consistency.",
    "Story Structure and Turning Points": "The story is well-structured, with distinct acts and turning points that effectively escalate tension and conflict. Each act builds on the previous one, leading to a satisfying climax. The structure supports the narrative's thematic exploration, though the final resolution could be more surprising to enhance emotional impact.",
    "Conflict Depth and Antagonism": "The conflict spans internal, personal, and extrapersonal levels, with the younger generation's internal struggle, the generational clash, and the external threat of the aliens. The antagonistic forces are diverse and meaningful, though the internal conflicts could be more deeply explored to enhance the story's complexity and emotional resonance."
