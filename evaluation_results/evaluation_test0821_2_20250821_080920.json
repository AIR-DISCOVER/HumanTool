    "Character Depth and Empathy": "The protagonist is portrayed with depth, particularly in her reflections on past experiences and her evolving understanding of her daughter's emotional state. The story effectively evokes empathy for her plight, especially as she grapples with the implications of immortality. However, the daughter's character could be further developed to enhance the emotional impact and complexity of their relationship.",
    "Thematic Expression and Ideological Argument": "The story compellingly addresses universal themes of love, memory, and the meaning of life versus immortality. The climax effectively conveys the controlling idea that life's value lies in experiencing love and loss. The narrative also presents a balanced view of the opposing perspective on immortality, avoiding didacticism.",
    "Narrative Craft and Visual Storytelling": "The narrative employs vivid imagery, particularly in the description of the hand-worn bracelet and the mother's memories. Dialogue is used effectively to reveal character subtext, though at times it could be more concise. The story could benefit from a more subtle integration of visual motifs to enhance its emotional depth.",
    "Plot Logic and Causality": "The plot follows a logical progression, with events unfolding in a coherent manner. However, some transitions between scenes could be smoother, and the causal chain could be strengthened to avoid any perception of coincidence, particularly in the daughter's emotional awakening.",
    "Story Structure and Turning Points": "The story is well-structured, with clear acts and turning points that drive the narrative forward. The crisis and climax are effectively executed, providing meaningful value changes. However, some scenes could be more tightly constructed to enhance the buildup of tension and emotional stakes.",
    "Conflict Depth and Antagonism": "The story presents a layered conflict, exploring internal, personal, and extrapersonal dimensions. The protagonist's internal struggle and the societal implications of immortality are well-developed, though the daughter's internal conflict could be more fully realized to heighten the narrative tension."
