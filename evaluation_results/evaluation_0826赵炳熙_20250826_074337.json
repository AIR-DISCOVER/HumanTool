    "Character Depth and Empathy": "The characters are divided into generational archetypes, with the young portrayed as technologically dependent and the old as resistant. While the story presents dilemmas, such as the emotional and creative decline, it lacks deep individual character exploration and empathy, focusing more on generational conflict than personal transformation.",
    "Thematic Expression and Ideological Argument": "The theme of technology versus human essence is clear, with the controlling idea suggesting that reliance on technology leads to societal and personal downfall. The narrative effectively argues the dangers of losing human qualities to technological advancements, though it could benefit from deeper exploration of the ideological nuances.",
    "Narrative Craft and Visual Storytelling": "The story dramatizes the conflict between innovation and tradition, effectively presenting the opposing viewpoints. The climax reveals the severe consequences of technological dependence, though the presentation could be more emotionally resonant and less didactic in its demonstration of the theme.",

However, the causality between events, particularly the psychological breakdown due to immortality drugs, could be more intricately developed to enhance the narrative's impact.",

However, the crisis lacks a true dilemma for individual characters, focusing more on generational shifts than personal choices.",
    "Conflict Depth and Antagonism": "The conflict is primarily generational, with technology as the antagonist. While the societal and ideological tensions are evident, the depth of conflict across personal and internal levels is underdeveloped, limiting the narrative's exploration of profound human challenges."
