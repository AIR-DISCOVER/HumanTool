    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The core concept of ancient magic reawakening to combat alien invaders is intriguing and offers a fresh take on survival narratives. The protagonist, Eileen, is driven by her newfound powers and the hope they bring, providing a strong character drive. Her journey from discovery to leadership is well-motivated, though further depth in her internal conflicts could enhance multidimensionality.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The setting is vividly described, with a post-apocalyptic Earth and the resurgence of magic. The inciting incident—Eileen's discovery of her magical abilities—serves as a pivotal turning point, effectively setting the stage for the ensuing drama. However, more specific details about the alien threat and the world before the invasion could enrich the backdrop.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The narrative follows a clear three-act structure, with escalating conflicts both external (alien pursuit) and internal (trust issues within the group). The progression from survival to active resistance is well-paced, and the complications arising from suspected betrayal add depth to the plot.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The climax is impactful, with the suspected traitor's sacrifice providing a poignant resolution to the trust issues. The controlling idea—that unity and sacrifice can overcome formidable odds—is confirmed through the characters' actions and the ultimate victory. The ending offers a satisfying closure with the promise of rebuilding.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The narrative effectively integrates themes of trust, betrayal, and redemption, which are explored through character interactions and plot developments. These themes are consistently woven into the story, enhancing its emotional resonance.",
