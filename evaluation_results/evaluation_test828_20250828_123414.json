    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The protagonist faces a profound moral dilemma: whether to risk exposing the truth about the drug's side effects to restore his loved ones' memories or to remain silent and forgotten. His internal transformation is evident as he shifts from despair to active resistance, driven by personal motivation and the emotional weight of lost memories.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The use of past objects and photographs as memory triggers is well-executed, serving as catalysts for character decisions and emotional shifts. While sensory descriptions are present, they could be more vivid to enhance the emotional impact.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The narrative clearly delineates the intergenerational timeline, contrasting the protagonist's experiences at ages 28 and 85. The long-term consequences of the drug's use are effectively portrayed through societal changes and personal relationships.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The depiction of government and pharmaceutical interests is multifaceted, showing their motives to suppress the truth. However, the narrative could benefit from more detailed institutional evidence to deepen the ethical complexity.",

    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending achieves dual resonance, addressing both personal closure and societal reflection on the drug's use. It maintains moral ambiguity, avoiding simplistic resolutions and highlighting ongoing societal debates."
