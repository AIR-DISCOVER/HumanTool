    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The protagonist faces a profound moral dilemma between revealing the truth about the drug's side effects and protecting his descendants. This choice leads to a significant internal transformation, as he ultimately prioritizes truth and societal welfare over personal gain. The narrative effectively uses internal conflict and temporal contrasts to highlight this arc.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "While the story does not heavily rely on sensory details or recurring objects as memory anchors, the protagonist's memories of being excluded and witnessing his children's privilege serve as emotional catalysts. More specific sensory descriptions could enhance the narrative's emotional depth.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The narrative spans several decades, illustrating the long-term consequences of the protagonist's exclusion and the societal impact of the drug. The contrast between the protagonist's aging and his children's eternal youth is effectively portrayed, highlighting generational differences and consequences.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The government's decision to withhold information about the drug's side effects is depicted with some complexity, showing a mix of self-interest and fear. However, the institutional motives could be further developed to avoid a purely villainous portrayal and enhance the ethical complexity.",

The protagonist's internal struggle, family tensions, and government pressure are causally interconnected, pushing him to a critical decision point. The diverse antagonistic forces add depth to the narrative.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The narrative features clear value shifts, such as trust to suspicion and ignorance to awareness, with a coherent causal chain. While the progression is logical, some transitions could be more nuanced to avoid predictability and enhance emotional impact.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The story follows a clear structure with escalating tension leading to a climax where the truth is revealed. The midpoint introduces a significant reversal as the protagonist decides to expose the truth. However, the climax could be more unexpected to heighten dramatic impact.",
    "Emotional Punch & Aftershock": "Key scenes, such as the revelation of the drug's side effects and the protagonist's decision to reveal the truth, deliver strong emotional impact. These moments have lasting effects on the characters and society, with emotional echoes throughout the narrative.",
