    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The protagonist, Chen Jiaru, faces a significant moral dilemma, particularly in the final act where she must choose between personal safety and revealing the truth. However, the internal conflict and transformation could be more deeply explored, with more emphasis on her psychological journey and the nuances of her decision-making process.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The narrative lacks specific sensory details or recurring objects that serve as memory anchors. The plot progression is driven by events rather than sensory triggers, which could enhance emotional depth and character development.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story effectively spans a significant timeline, showing Chen Jiaru's journey from 28 to 85 years old. The long-term consequences of her early exclusion from the drug are well depicted, though more explicit contrasts between her younger and older self could strengthen this aspect.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The narrative presents a basic conflict between the protagonist and institutional forces, but the depiction of these institutions lacks depth. More nuanced exploration of the institutions' motives and internal conflicts would enhance the ethical complexity.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The investigation into the drug's side effects provides a clear narrative drive. However, the structure of clues and the risks involved in uncovering them could be more intricately developed to build suspense and engagement.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story includes internal, interpersonal, and institutional conflicts, but these layers could be more tightly interwoven. The protagonist's internal struggles and relationships with others could be more prominently featured alongside the institutional challenges.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The narrative demonstrates clear value shifts, particularly in the protagonist's journey from exclusion to empowerment. The causal links between events are generally logical, though some transitions could be more smoothly integrated.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The story follows a clear structure with a midpoint revelation and a climactic decision. However, the escalation of stakes and the impact of the midpoint could be more pronounced to enhance narrative tension.",
    "Emotional Punch & Aftershock": "While the climax has an emotional impact, the aftershocks of key events are not fully explored. The emotional resonance could be deepened by showing how these events continue to affect the protagonist and her world.",
    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending addresses both personal and public dimensions, with Chen Jiaru achieving personal closure and societal change. However, the resolution could benefit from more ambiguity and complexity to avoid a simplistic conclusion."
