    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The protagonist faces a moral dilemma in choosing to expose the truth about the drug's side effects, risking personal relationships and safety. However, the internal transformation and depth of character could be more explicitly detailed, with more focus on internal reasoning and long-term changes.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The narrative effectively uses memory anchors, such as past objects and photographs, to trigger emotional and cognitive changes. These anchors play a causal role in plot progression, though more sensory specificity could enhance their impact.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story clearly delineates an intergenerational timeline, contrasting the protagonist's life at 28 and 85, and shows the long-term consequences of societal changes. The impact of early-life decisions on later life is well depicted.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "While the government and drug companies are portrayed as antagonistic forces, their motivations could be more nuanced to avoid a purely villainous depiction. More specific institutional evidence and diverse motives would add depth.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The protagonist's investigation into the drug's side effects drives the plot effectively, with a logical connection of clues and rising tension. However, the risks and costs associated with evidence gathering could be more pronounced.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The narrative presents conflicts on internal, interpersonal, and institutional levels, which are well interconnected. The protagonist's personal struggle is amplified by societal pressures, creating a rich tapestry of conflict.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The story features clear value shifts, such as from despair to hope, and these are generally linked through a causal chain. Some transitions could be more smoothly integrated to enhance cohesion.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The narrative structure is clear, with escalating stakes leading to a climax that changes societal perceptions. The midpoint and climax are effective, though the irreversible nature of the climax could be more emphasized.",
    "Emotional Punch & Aftershock": "Key scenes deliver emotional impact, particularly in the protagonist's interactions with family. These emotions resonate throughout the story, though further exploration of aftershocks could deepen the narrative.",
