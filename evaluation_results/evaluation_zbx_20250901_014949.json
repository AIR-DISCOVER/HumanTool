    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The protagonist's journey from resignation to activism is well-developed, with a clear moral dilemma regarding whether to expose the truth about the drug's side effects. The internal transformation from acceptance of fate to active resistance is convincingly portrayed, supported by the character's internal reasoning and eventual public action.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "While the narrative lacks specific recurring sensory images or objects, the protagonist's memories of being excluded from the benefits of the drug serve as emotional anchors. These memories drive his actions, though more sensory details could enhance the emotional impact.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story effectively spans generations, contrasting the protagonist's life at 28 and 85, and highlighting the long-term consequences of societal decisions. The narrative clearly shows how early-life exclusion leads to later-life activism, with significant repercussions for both the protagonist and society.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The narrative presents a government and pharmaceutical company that prioritize power and profit over public welfare. While the institutions are depicted as villainous, there is some complexity in their motives, though further exploration of their internal logic and fears would add depth.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The protagonist's investigation into the drug's effects is a central plotline, with a logical progression of evidence gathering that builds tension. The narrative effectively uses the investigation to drive the story forward, though the risks involved could be more explicitly detailed.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story includes internal, interpersonal, and societal conflicts, particularly the protagonist's internal struggle and the societal upheaval caused by the drug's revelation. However, the interpersonal layer could be more pronounced to fully realize the multi-layered conflict.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "Each act of the story brings significant value shifts, such as the protagonist's transition from resignation to activism and society's shift from ignorance to awareness. These shifts are causally linked, creating a cohesive narrative without relying on coincidences.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The narrative structure is clear, with a significant midpoint where the protagonist decides to reveal the truth, leading to an escalating climax. The irreversible societal change at the climax is both inevitable and unexpected, effectively concluding the narrative arc.",
    "Emotional Punch & Aftershock": "Key scenes, such as the public revelation of the drug's effects, deliver strong emotional impact. While these moments resonate throughout the story, further exploration of their long-term emotional effects on characters and society would enhance the aftershock.",
    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending successfully addresses both personal and societal issues, with the protagonist finding inner peace and society beginning to reassess the value of life. The conclusion maintains moral ambiguity, avoiding simplistic resolutions and encouraging reflection on broader themes."
