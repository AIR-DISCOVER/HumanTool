    "Character Depth and Empathy": "The protagonist is introduced with a clear motivation and emotional response to the immortality drug policy, yet the story lacks detailed exploration of their internal struggles or complex decision-making processes. The empathy is somewhat established through their observations and eventual actions, but the character's depth could be further developed.",
    "Thematic Expression and Ideological Argument": "The story effectively presents the theme of technology versus ethics, with the immortality drug serving as a central ideological conflict. The climax provides a clear controlling idea about the consequences of unchecked technological advancement, although the opposing viewpoint could be more robustly dramatized.",
    "Narrative Craft and Visual Storytelling": "The outline suggests a narrative that relies heavily on exposition rather than vivid, concrete storytelling. The lack of specific dialogue or visual elements limits the potential for immersive storytelling and emotional engagement, and there is no indication of an image system to enrich the narrative.",
    "Plot Logic and Causality": "The plot follows a logical progression from introduction to climax, with the protagonist's actions driving the narrative forward. However, the causality between events could be more intricately woven to enhance the sense of inevitability and realism, particularly in the protagonist's discovery and revelation of the drug's side effects.",
    "Story Structure and Turning Points": "The structure is clear, with distinct phases leading to the climax and resolution. While the turning points are present, they lack the depth of conflict and dilemma necessary to create a powerful emotional impact. The crisis and climax could be more unexpected and inevitable to maximize their effect.",
    "Conflict Depth and Antagonism": "The story outlines a societal conflict between immortals and natural agers, but the depth of antagonism across internal, personal, and extrapersonal levels is underdeveloped. The protagonist's internal conflict and the broader societal implications could be more thoroughly explored to reflect the principle that \"Life is conflict.\""
