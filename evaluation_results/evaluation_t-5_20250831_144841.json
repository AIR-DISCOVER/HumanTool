    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "Chen Jiaru's character is well-developed, facing a clear moral dilemma between revealing the truth and protecting herself. Her transformation from a young, excluded individual to an elderly truth-bearer is evident, though the internal reasoning could be more deeply explored.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The narrative lacks specific sensory details or recurring memory anchors that drive the plot. While the concept of exclusion is central, it is not tied to specific sensory images or objects.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story effectively uses an intergenerational timeline, showing Chen's progression from 28 to 85 years old. Her early exclusion has long-term consequences, leading to her eventual revelation and societal change.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The depiction of government and scientific institutions is multifaceted, showing their interests and fears. However, the narrative could benefit from more detailed evidence of institutional motives and actions.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "Chen's investigation drives the plot, with clues about the drug's side effects gradually revealed. The suspense could be heightened with more detailed risks and costs associated with evidence gathering.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story presents internal, interpersonal, and societal conflicts, with Chen's personal struggles intertwined with broader societal issues. These conflicts are interconnected but could be more deeply explored.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The narrative includes value shifts, such as trust to suspicion, but could improve causal cohesion by more clearly linking motivations and actions without relying on coincidences.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The narrative structure is clear, with a midpoint revealing the drug's side effects and a climax involving Chen's public revelation. The escalation of pressure is consistent, though the climax could be more unexpected.",

    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending resonates on both personal and public levels, with Chen achieving psychological closure and societal change. It maintains moral ambiguity, avoiding simplistic resolutions."
