    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The character Chen Jiaru faces a significant moral dilemma, particularly at the climax, where she must choose between personal safety and public truth. However, her internal transformation and the depth of her moral conflict could be more thoroughly explored with more detailed internal reasoning and emotional depth.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The narrative lacks specific sensory details and recurring memory anchors that could enhance the emotional and cognitive depth of the story. The use of sensory images or objects as triggers for memory or decision-making is underdeveloped.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story effectively spans a significant timeline, showing the long-term consequences of the protagonist's early-life exclusion from the immortality drug. The contrast between her younger and older self is clear, though more detailed behavioral changes over time could strengthen this aspect.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The story presents a basic depiction of institutional actions and their impact on the protagonist. However, the ethical complexity of the government and scientists' motives could be more nuanced, with more detailed exploration of their interests and fears.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "Chen Jiaru's investigation into the drug's truth drives the narrative effectively, with a logical progression of discoveries. While the investigation creates suspense, the rising costs and risks associated with evidence gathering could be more pronounced.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The narrative includes internal and social conflicts, but these layers are not as intricately interconnected as they could be. The story would benefit from more simultaneous pressure from different conflict levels to push the protagonist to her limits.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The story includes clear value shifts, particularly in the protagonist's understanding of the drug and her role in society. However, the causal connections between scenes could be strengthened to avoid any perception of coincidence.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The narrative structure includes a clear climax where the protagonist makes a decisive choice. However, the escalation of stakes and the midpoint reversal could be more pronounced to enhance the narrative tension.",
    "Emotional Punch & Aftershock": "Key scenes have emotional impact, particularly the climax, but the aftershocks of these emotions could be more effectively woven into subsequent actions and decisions to deepen the emotional resonance.",
    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending addresses both personal and public dimensions, with Chen Jiaru achieving personal closure and societal change. However, the resolution could retain more moral ambiguity and openness to enhance its complexity."
