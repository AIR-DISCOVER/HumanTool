    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The text lacks character development, providing only a broad categorization of individuals affected by the drug policy. The protagonist's personal desires and struggles are not explored, limiting emotional engagement.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story hints at a controlling idea regarding the unforeseen consequences of technological advancements and societal inequality, but it remains underdeveloped due to the narrative's brevity.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The conflict is implied but not actively developed. The narrative jumps from the introduction of the drug to the discovery of side effects without exploring escalating tensions or challenges faced by the protagonist.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The potential for multi-level conflict exists, including personal, societal, and ethical dimensions, but the text does not delve into these areas, resulting in a superficial treatment of conflict.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The narrative lacks clear structural turning points and dynamic rhythm. The transition from the introduction of the drug to the revelation of side effects is abrupt, missing opportunities for tension and development.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "There is no evident crisis decision or dilemma faced by the protagonist. The narrative does not explore personal choices or moral conflicts, which are crucial for character consistency and depth.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The revelation of side effects serves as a climax but lacks depth and impact due to insufficient buildup and exploration of its implications on the protagonist and society.",

    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The narrative is concise and avoids clichés, but it lacks detailed scenes and dialogue that could enrich the story. The concept is original, but the execution is underdeveloped."
