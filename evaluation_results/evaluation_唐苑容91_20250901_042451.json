    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The story offers a unique thematic perspective by exploring the societal impact of a drug that halts aging, focusing on the excluded \"lost generation\" and their struggle for truth and change. It goes beyond simple critique to propose new possibilities for societal reform and ethical transparency.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The narrative is driven by the protagonist's discovery of the drug's side effects and the subsequent investigation, creating tension through the exploration of unknown truths rather than merely resolving crises. The plot effectively uses curiosity and exploration as its driving force.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The protagonist demonstrates significant agency by uncovering the truth and leading a movement for change. His growth from acceptance of exclusion to active definer of societal reform is well-developed, showcasing a transformation from victim to creator.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The setting is based on a thought-provoking concept of a world altered by an anti-aging drug, which is central to the story's appeal. The narrative would collapse without this core concept, and the setting continuously sparks curiosity and intellectual engagement.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The structure supports the core concept by following the protagonist's journey from discovery to revelation, though it could benefit from more unconventional pacing to enhance the protagonist's spiritual journey. The fit is solid but could be more organic.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story presents an unconventional ethical dilemma involving the concealment of the drug's side effects and its use for population control. The protagonist's choices reflect long-term wisdom and responsibility, transcending simple moral dichotomies.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The emotional depth is rooted in the protagonist's long-term reflection on his exclusion and the societal impact of the drug. While effective, the emotional experience could be deepened through more sensory details and daily routines.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The narrative contains moments of creative sparks, such as the discovery of government documents and the international conference, but these could be more vividly detailed to enhance their impact and ignite the reader's imagination.",
    "Emotional Punch & Aftershock": "The narrative voice effectively conveys the protagonist's perspective and the story's themes, though it could further immerse the reader in the protagonist's thought process through a more distinctive style or tone.",
    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending opens new possibilities by proposing societal reform and transparency in drug use, leaving the reader with a hopeful imaginative space. It effectively shifts values and grants the characters a new sense of purpose."
