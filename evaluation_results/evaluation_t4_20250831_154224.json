    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "Chen Jiaru's journey from exclusion to revelation provides a clear arc, but her internal motivations and moral dilemmas could be more deeply explored. The choice between revealing the truth and personal safety is present but lacks detailed internal conflict and transformation.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The narrative lacks specific sensory details or recurring memory anchors that drive the plot or character decisions. The focus is more on plot progression than sensory or emotional triggers.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story spans from Chen's youth to old age, effectively showing the long-term consequences of the drug's exclusion. However, more explicit contrasts between her younger and older self could enhance this aspect.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The government and scientific institutions are portrayed as antagonistic forces, but their motivations are not deeply explored, reducing the complexity of their ethical portrayal.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The investigation into the drug's effects provides a solid narrative drive, though the clues and risks involved could be more intricately layered to heighten suspense and engagement.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story includes internal, interpersonal, and institutional conflicts, but these layers could be more intricately connected to amplify the protagonist's challenges and choices.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The narrative has clear value shifts, such as from ignorance to revelation, but the causal links between scenes could be more explicitly connected to enhance cohesion.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The structure follows a clear progression, but the midpoint and climax could be more dramatically defined to increase their impact and inevitability.",
