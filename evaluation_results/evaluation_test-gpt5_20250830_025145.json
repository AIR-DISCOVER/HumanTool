    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The protagonist experiences internal conflict and growth, particularly in the second act where he doubts his leadership abilities. However, the moral dilemma is somewhat conventional, focusing on self-doubt and sacrifice rather than a complex choice between equally compelling options.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The narrative lacks specific sensory details or recurring objects that serve as memory anchors. The glowing ancient book is a plot device but does not evoke emotional or cognitive changes through sensory specificity.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story hints at intergenerational elements through the family legacy of magic, but it does not deeply explore long-term consequences or generational contrasts. The focus remains on immediate events rather than a broader temporal span.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The alien invaders are depicted as a monolithic threat without nuanced motivations. The narrative lacks depth in exploring the ethical complexities of their technology or institutional structures.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The plot involves the discovery and exploration of magic, but the investigative aspect is not deeply layered. The narrative lacks a strong sense of rhythm and suspense typically associated with clue-driven stories.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story includes internal, interpersonal, and extra-personal conflicts, particularly the protagonist's internal struggles and the external threat of aliens. However, these conflicts could be more intricately interwoven to amplify tension.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The narrative includes clear value shifts, such as despair to hope and doubt to resolve. However, the causal chain is somewhat straightforward, lacking unexpected twists or profound causal complexity.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The story follows a clear structure with escalating stakes, a midpoint where the protagonist gains new insights, and a climactic battle. The climax is effective, though somewhat predictable in its execution.",
    "Emotional Punch & Aftershock": "Key scenes, such as the loss of an ally and the protagonist's sacrifice, carry emotional weight. However, the aftershocks of these emotions could be more deeply explored in subsequent actions and reflections.",
    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending addresses both personal and public dimensions, with the protagonist's sacrifice and the societal impact of magic's resurgence. It balances personal closure with broader societal implications, though it leans towards a hopeful resolution."
