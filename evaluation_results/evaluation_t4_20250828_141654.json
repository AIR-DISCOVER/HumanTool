These anchors are specific and recur throughout the narrative, effectively driving character decisions and plot progression.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story clearly delineates generational differences and the long-term consequences of societal reliance on the immortality drug. The protagonist's age progression from 28 to 85 highlights the contrast between generations and the repercussions of past decisions, effectively supporting the narrative's thematic depth.",

While the institutions are portrayed with diverse motives, the causal link to the protagonist's fate could be more explicitly detailed.",
