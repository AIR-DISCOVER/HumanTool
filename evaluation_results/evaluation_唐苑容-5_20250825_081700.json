  "submitted_text": "第一部分：故事概括（强化版）\r\n\r\n未来世界因永生药物被彻底改变，政府规定只有26岁以下且通过严格人类价值分级的精英才能获得药物。年长的主角为确保天才女儿获得资格，投身政治，成为制度的狂热维护者。\r\n然而，随着社会冲突升级、反抗者以血抗争、女儿理念与父亲分裂，最终药物副作用爆发，主角亲眼目睹女儿在永生的痛苦中被毁灭。半生的权谋与牺牲换来的不是幸福，而是赤裸裸的虚无，让读者直面“对永生执念的终极拷问”。\r\n\r\n第二部分：第一幕（起）\r\n\r\n世界背景：科技极度发达，永生药物稀缺，社会实施“人类分级论”：通过教育成就、社会贡献、智力指数来评定资格，底层年轻人无望，社会严重撕裂。\r\n\r\n主角设定：年近五十的普通公务员，妻子早逝，唯一的女儿是科学天才，正值药物门槛年龄。\r\n\r\n初始冲突：社会爆发大规模抗议，反抗组织质疑分级制度“把生命当资源”；主角担忧混乱影响女儿资格，决定不惜一切维护规则。\r\n\r\n情感伏笔：女儿虽然是受益者，却私下怜悯那些被制度淘汰的人，和父亲价值观埋下裂痕。\r\n\r\n第三部分：第二幕（承）\r\n\r\n主角行动强化：\r\n\r\n通过政治手腕爬升为意见领袖，发表“优势人类论”演讲，将药物分配包装成“文明生存必需的淘汰”。\r\n\r\n暗中推动对反抗组织的打压，甚至间接默许暴力镇压。\r\n\r\n情节张力增强：\r\n\r\n反抗组织有年轻人自焚抗议，社会出现恐怖袭击，局势愈发血腥。\r\n\r\n女儿亲眼目睹同龄人死亡，开始质问父亲的“正义”，两人关系急剧恶化。\r\n\r\n关键情节点：\r\n\r\n主角在一场全国直播的政治辩论中，被迫为制度辩护，对女儿的质问避而不答，公众开始怀疑他的真实动机。\r\n\r\n父女间的裂痕扩大：女儿对父亲说“你不是在保护我，你在保护你自己害怕失去的幻象。”\r\n\r\n第四部分：第三幕（转合）\r\n\r\n副作用曝光：药物的真相被揭露——永生会导致神经衰竭和感官扭曲，受试者在长达数十年的清醒痛苦中逐渐丧失人性。\r\n\r\n高潮场景强化：\r\n\r\n主角年老无药，亲眼看着女儿被副作用折磨，曾经聪慧美丽的女孩变成行尸走肉。\r\n\r\n女儿在痛苦间歇冷笑问父亲：“爸，你拼了半生换来的，是这个吗？”\r\n\r\n主角彻底崩溃，意识到自己半生的血汗、权谋和牺牲，不过是帮女儿抢到一个通往炼狱的门票。\r\n\r\n终局的虚无感：\r\n\r\n主角试图揭露真相，却发现社会早已麻木，对药物的执念无人能放下。\r\n\r\n他在孤独的老年里，陪伴着已经被副作用摧毁的女儿，心中只有一个刺耳的问题：“生命有限也许才是恩赐，我们到底在追逐什么？”\r\n\r\n结尾留白，读者感受到深刻的讽刺与荒凉。\r\n\r\n强化后的亮点\r\n\r\n冲突递进：不仅是父女对立，还有社会阶级对立、反抗组织血腥抗争、制度与道德的张力。\r\n\r\n情感深挖：父亲的爱从“保护”变质为“控制”，女儿从“信任”变为“痛恨”，副作用让父亲的虚无感达到最强烈。\r\n\r\n主题升华：讽刺对永生的盲目追逐，反问生命的价值何在。",
