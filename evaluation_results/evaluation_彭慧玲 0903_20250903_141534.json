It has the depth to sustain a longer narrative by exploring societal and ethical implications.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The protagonist is portrayed with clear motivations and a sense of isolation, which adds depth. However, the narrative could further explore his internal struggles and unconscious desires to enhance his multi-dimensionality.",

    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The conflict escalates as the protagonist discovers the report and attempts to expose the truth, but the escalation lacks intensity and complexity. The protagonist's efforts feel repetitive rather than progressively challenging.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The story touches on internal, interpersonal, and societal conflicts, but these could be more intricately interwoven to showcase a broader range of opposing forces and deepen the narrative tension.",

    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The protagonist faces a dilemma in choosing to expose the truth despite the odds, consistent with his character. However, the decision lacks the weight of a genuine crisis, as the stakes and consequences are not fully realized.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The story concludes with an open ending, which diminishes the impact of the climax. The lack of a definitive resolution or significant value shift leaves the narrative feeling unresolved and lacking in profound meaning.",
    "Emotional Punch & Aftershock": "The controlling idea about the perils of immortality is suggested but not fully confirmed or expressed through the climax, leaving the audience without a strong sense of closure or understanding.",
    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The narrative details are generally effective, with a clear setting and purpose for each scene. However, the writing could benefit from more originality and avoidance of clichés, particularly in dialogue and imagery, to enhance expression."
