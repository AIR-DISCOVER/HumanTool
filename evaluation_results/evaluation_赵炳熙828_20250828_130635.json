    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The protagonist, Aileen, experiences a moral dilemma when she must choose between her fear and her responsibility to save humanity. This choice leads to her internal transformation, but the narrative could benefit from deeper exploration of her internal conflicts and motivations.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The story lacks specific memory anchors or sensory details that could enhance the emotional depth and connection to the characters. The narrative focuses more on plot progression than on sensory or memory-driven elements.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The narrative does not clearly establish an intergenerational timeline or the long-term consequences of actions. The focus remains on immediate events rather than exploring the broader temporal impact on future generations.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The depiction of the alien invaders lacks depth and complexity, presenting them primarily as antagonistic forces without exploring their motives or ethical dimensions. The narrative could benefit from a more nuanced portrayal of the alien technology and its implications.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The story includes elements of discovery and exploration, but the investigative aspect is underdeveloped. The progression lacks a structured clue architecture that builds suspense and tension through evidence gathering.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The narrative presents conflicts on multiple levels, including internal (Aileen's fears), interpersonal (team dynamics), and extra-personal (alien threat). However, these conflicts could be more intricately woven to amplify the narrative tension.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The story includes several value shifts, such as fear to courage and isolation to unity, but the causal links between events could be stronger. The narrative sometimes relies on predictable plot turns rather than deeply motivated actions.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The narrative follows a clear structure with escalating stakes, leading to a climactic battle. The midpoint introduces a significant reversal with the discovery of the alien weapon, effectively raising the narrative tension.",
    "Emotional Punch & Aftershock": "Key scenes, such as Aileen's sacrifice, deliver emotional impact, but the aftershocks of these moments could be more thoroughly explored to deepen their resonance throughout the story.",
    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending addresses both personal and public dimensions, with Aileen's sacrifice leading to a new societal beginning. The narrative successfully balances personal closure with broader societal implications, though it could retain more moral ambiguity."
