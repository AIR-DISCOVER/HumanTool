    "Character Depth and Empathy": "The protagonist is portrayed with considerable depth, as his journey from jealousy to empathy is well-developed. The story effectively evokes empathy by highlighting the protagonist's internal conflict and eventual realization of love for his brother. However, the character arc could be more pronounced, with greater emphasis on the protagonist's transformation.",
    "Thematic Expression and Ideological Argument": "The story touches on themes of envy, love, and the consequences of immortality, but the controlling idea is not fully articulated. The narrative hints at the futility of jealousy and the inevitability of human suffering, yet it lacks a clear ideological argument that ties these themes together into a cohesive statement.",
    "Narrative Craft and Visual Storytelling": "The story presents dramatic moments, particularly in the protagonist's internal struggle and the climactic decision to sign the euthanasia document. However, the opposing viewpoints, such as the allure of immortality versus its consequences, are not fully dramatized, limiting the emotional impact and thematic depth.",
    "Plot Logic and Causality": "The plot logically progresses from the discovery of the immortality drug to the revelation of its side effects, creating a coherent causal chain. The protagonist's actions and reflections are motivated by past events, though the narrative could benefit from more complex interactions and consequences to enhance the story's depth.",
    "Story Structure and Turning Points": "The story follows a clear structure with distinct acts and turning points, such as the revelation of the drug's side effects and the protagonist's decision. However, the progression of complications and the ultimate crisis could be more intense and layered to heighten the narrative tension and emotional stakes.",
    "Conflict Depth and Antagonism": "The conflict primarily revolves around the protagonist's internal struggle and his relationship with his brother. While this is effectively portrayed, the external and extra-personal conflicts, such as societal implications of the immortality drug, are underexplored, limiting the story's complexity and the protagonist's challenges."
