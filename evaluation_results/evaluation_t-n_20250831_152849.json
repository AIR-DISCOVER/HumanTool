    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The professor faces internal struggles and doubts about his ability to lead humanity, especially after losing an ally. However, the moral dilemma is somewhat underdeveloped, as the choice to use magic against aliens is straightforward without significant personal cost or transformation.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The narrative mentions the professor's family legacy and ancient magical books, but lacks recurring sensory details or memory anchors that drive emotional or cognitive changes. The magical book's glow is a singular event rather than a recurring motif.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "While the story hints at the professor's family legacy, it doesn't effectively explore intergenerational dynamics or long-term consequences. The focus is more on immediate action rather than the impact of past decisions on future generations.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The aliens are depicted as technologically advanced and oppressive, but their motives are not deeply explored beyond being antagonistic. The narrative lacks a nuanced portrayal of institutional complexity or ethical dilemmas involving technology.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The plot involves the discovery and exploration of magic, but lacks a structured investigative drive or layered clues. The progression is more linear, focusing on learning magic rather than uncovering mysteries or evidence.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story includes internal doubts, interpersonal loss, and the external threat of aliens, creating multi-layered conflict. However, the connections between these layers could be stronger, with more emphasis on how they amplify each other.",

    "Emotional Punch & Aftershock": "The professor's sacrifice provides an emotional peak, but the aftershocks are limited to the immediate aftermath. The narrative could benefit from more exploration of long-term emotional impacts on characters and society.",
    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending addresses both personal sacrifice and societal liberation, providing closure on multiple levels. However, the resolution is somewhat straightforward, lacking moral ambiguity or lingering societal issues."
