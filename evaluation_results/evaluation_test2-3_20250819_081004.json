    "Character Depth and Empathy": "The protagonist is well-developed, facing the profound choice between immortality and the authenticity of finite life. The narrative effectively builds empathy by showing the protagonist's internal struggle and eventual transformation. However, the emotional depth could be enhanced by further exploring the protagonist's relationships and inner conflicts.",
    "Thematic Expression and Ideological Argument": "The story powerfully conveys themes of existential reflection and the value of finite life. The climax effectively encapsulates the controlling idea that true meaning is found in embracing life's limitations. The opposing viewpoint of immortality is well dramatized, though the argument could be deepened by exploring more diverse perspectives.",
    "Narrative Craft and Visual Storytelling": "The narrative structure is clear, but the visual storytelling could be more vivid and immersive. While the protagonist's fading shadow is a strong visual metaphor, the story could benefit from more dynamic and concrete descriptions to enhance emotional engagement and tension.",
    "Plot Logic and Causality": "The plot is logically structured, with events unfolding in a coherent and causally linked manner. The protagonist's journey from denial to acceptance is believable, though some transitions, particularly the protagonist's initial reluctance, could be more convincingly motivated.",
    "Story Structure and Turning Points": "The three-act structure is effectively utilized, with clear turning points that drive the narrative forward. The crisis and climax are well-executed, providing meaningful value changes. The progression of dilemmas is compelling, though the final resolution could be more emotionally charged.",
    "Conflict Depth and Antagonism": "While the internal and personal conflicts are well-developed, the extrapersonal forces could be more complex and impactful. The societal pressure to maintain immortality is present but lacks the depth and diversity that would push the protagonist to their limits. More intricate antagonistic forces could enhance the story's tension and stakes."
