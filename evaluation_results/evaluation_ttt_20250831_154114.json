    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "Chen Jiaru faces a significant moral dilemma in choosing between revealing the truth and protecting herself, which leads to her transformation. However, the internal reasoning and psychological drivers behind her choices are not deeply explored, limiting the depth of her character arc.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "The narrative lacks recurring sensory anchors or specific memory triggers that play a causal role in plot progression. The story could benefit from more sensory details to enhance emotional and cognitive changes.",
    "Intergenerational Span & Long-term Causality": "The story spans Chen Jiaru's life from 28 to 85, showing long-term consequences of her early decisions. The generational differences and repercussions are well-presented, although more contrast between young and old behaviors could strengthen this aspect.",
    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The depiction of government and scientific institutions is present, with motives and fears hinted at. However, the complexity of these institutions and their direct impact on Chen Jiaru's choices could be more thoroughly developed.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "Chen Jiaru's investigation into the drug's truth drives the plot effectively, with layered clues and rising tension. The narrative maintains a logical connection between discoveries, though the risks and costs of evidence gathering could be heightened.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The story presents internal, interpersonal, and institutional conflicts, but the causal interconnection between these layers is not fully developed. More amplification of conflicts across different scenes would enhance the narrative.",
    "Value Turns & Causal Cohesion": "The narrative includes value shifts, such as trust to suspicion, but these shifts could be more cohesively linked through a causal chain. The avoidance of coincidences is commendable, yet some turns feel underexplained.",
    "Hierarchy of Beats & Midpoint/Climax Design": "The narrative structure is clear, with a midpoint reversal and an inevitable climax. The pressure escalates appropriately, though the climax could deliver a more unexpected turn.",
    "Emotional Punch & Aftershock": "Key scenes lack strong emotional peaks and subsequent aftershocks. The emotional impact of Chen Jiaru's choices could resonate more deeply throughout the text, affecting later actions and memories.",
    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending addresses both personal and societal issues, with Chen Jiaru achieving psychological closure and societal change. The narrative maintains moral ambiguity, avoiding simplistic resolutions."
