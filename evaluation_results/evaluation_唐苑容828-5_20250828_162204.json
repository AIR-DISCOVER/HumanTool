    "Character Depth & Moral Dilemma Arc": "The protagonist, El, faces a compelling moral dilemma, choosing between embracing power and responsibility or rejecting them to maintain personal freedom. His internal conflict is well-developed, with clear initial desires and a significant transformation, though not in the traditional heroic sense. The narrative effectively uses his internal reasoning and memories to drive his choices.",
    "Memory Anchors & Sensory Specificity": "While the narrative hints at emotional and cognitive changes, it lacks specific sensory details or recurring objects that serve as memory anchors. The story could benefit from more vivid sensory descriptions to enhance emotional depth and plot progression.",

    "Institutional & Tech Ethical Complexity": "The narrative touches on institutional dynamics through the resistance organization and its internal debates. However, the depiction of these institutions lacks depth and multifaceted motives, focusing more on the protagonist's personal journey than on institutional complexities.",
    "Investigative Drive & Clue Architecture": "The story is not driven by an investigation or evidence-gathering plotline. There is little emphasis on clues or a structured revelation process, which limits the narrative's rhythm and suspense.",
    "Multi-layered Conflict": "The narrative presents internal, interpersonal, and extra-personal conflicts, particularly through El's internal struggle, his relationship with his deceased friend, and societal expectations. These conflicts are interconnected, though the extra-personal conflict could be more developed.",

    "Dual Resonance of Ending: Personal & Public": "The ending resonates on both personal and public levels, with El's personal closure juxtaposed against the ambiguous fate of humanity. The narrative maintains moral ambiguity, avoiding simplistic resolutions and leaving open questions about responsibility and freedom."
